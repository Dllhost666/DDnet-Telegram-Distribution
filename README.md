# 🔔DDnet-Telegram-Distribution

🧲This code is intended for distribution in Tellegram channels!

🎉Application is easy to use and Simple waiting for mailing....

🍀Program will be updated over time, but at the moment we have: Fully working application, Translated into Russian (Soon will be English!), Mailing to 15 channels. For now the mailing works for public channels but I am already working on private channels)))).

# ❓How does the code work?

But before that you need to go to this site -- ( https://my.telegram.org ) click on API development tools and fill in the form, then get api_id and api_hash, then go to main.py and fill in where it says api ai here and api hash here.

1) Run via .bat or .exe file (choose your taste | as you like).
If something does not work then write me for help in Discord: errorrr_edm

2)After you are asked to enter your number (to which telegram is bound).

3)Once you have entered the number you will be asked to enter the code that came to you and then if there is 2 authentication then enter the password that you specified.

4)After you will be asked to enter the message that will be sent to the telegram channels.

5)Now it is left to enter links to telegram channels through the space up to 15 pieces!

🎉 Congratulations, now you can send messages to the channels, but you can't send too much because you may be banned, so be careful).
