# 🔔DDnet-Telegram-Distribution

🧲This code is intended for distribution in Tellegram channels!

🎉Application is easy to use and Simple waiting for mailing....

🍀Program will be updated over time, but at the moment we have: Fully working application, Translated into Russian (Soon will be English!), Mailing to 15 channels. For now the mailing works for public channels but I am already working on private channels)))).

# ❓How does the code work?

But before that you need to go to this site - ( https://my.telegram.org ) click on API Development Tools and fill out the form, then get api_id and api_hash. Next, see the startup instructions!

1) Run via .bat or .exe file (choose your taste | whatever you like).
If something does not work, write me in Discord: errorrrr_edm

2)After that you will be asked to enter api hash and api id which we have already taken from the site (see the top) then it is already necessary to enter your phone number (to which telegram is bound).

3)After entering your number, you will be asked to enter the code that came to you, and then if there are 2 authentications, enter the password that you specified.

4)After that you will be asked to enter the message that will be sent to the telegram channels.

5)Now all that's left to do is enter the links to the telegram channels through the space up to 15 pieces!

🎉 Congratulations, now you can send messages to the channels, but you can't send too much because you may be banned, so be careful).

# 🔔Update 07.08.24

🎉 In this update I added a feature to allow you to enter api hash and api id via the .bat or .exe itself.

🍀 Also fixed minor bugs like closing the program after entering a phone number
